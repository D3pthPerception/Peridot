		<h2>Lapis Lazuli's confusing character</h2>
		<p>Lapis Lazulis is a gem from a show titled "Steven Universe." Steven first meets her when he finds out she is trapped inside of a mirror, in the episode titled "Mirror Gem.
		She then goes through a series of even more traumatic experiences but eventually comes around to Steven's side.

	<p>What makes her character so interesting? </p>
	<ol>
		<li>She does love Peridot and Steven, as shown above of them dancing. But, she leaves everything at the drop of the hat out of fear of the diamonds.</li>
		<li>Lapis seems to be one of the most hated and beloved characters of the series for all the toxic behaviors she shows in her relationships. For example, Peridot wants to impress her so much but Lapis basically shuts her down.</li>
		<li> Her forced fusion Malachite (Jasper/Lapis) brought her so much pain and suffering. Throughout the show it is shown that her psyche never really recovered from this.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Friends and Enemys</h2>
	<p>
	
		Lapis has made friends and enemys with many people. Throughout the show the only person she would have really considered a "Friend" was Steven because of his kindness. She does warm up to Peridot eventually though.
