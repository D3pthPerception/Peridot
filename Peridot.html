		<h2>Peridot is objectively the best character</h2>
		<p>Peridot is another gem villian Steven was able to redeem. She lost her limb enhancers and turned into the tiny angry cinnamon roll we all know and love. Her most famous catch phrase is calling everyone a "Clod" We love an angry green fella.

	<p>What makes her character the best? </p>
	<ol>
		<li>Peridot is honestly the comic relief of the show. The best part is how much she hated Steven, not unlike other villians of the show. She slowly warmed up to everyone and that is honestly one of the best parts of her character.</li>
		<li>Her dynamic with Lapis is very interesting. The fans of the show seem to ship them but in the end their relationship is extremely toxic. In "Rasing The Barn" Peridot genuinely did not want to leave. She was almost forced to uproot her home. This makes Lapis look awful but in her defense she also has a lot of trauma. (Not a defense for such toxic behavior)</li>
		<li> When she becomes depressed after Lapis leaves it really hits home. This show is very well known for its portrayal of mental ilnesses but this one takes the cake for the most accurate. <i> "	
And good job with that! I feel just great now that I know that nothing's ever going to get better! Everything is just ruined forever! We can't get any of it back! Not my home! Not Lapis! And not this crummy planet, either! We might as well just throw it all in the garbage and toss ourselves in after because it's all just hopeless trash!"</i> -Peridot Back to the Kindergarten. </li>

	<h2>Peridot's Friends</h2>
